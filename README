Ampify 🎸

AI-powered guitar amp setting recommender

Overview

Ampify is an AI application that takes in a song input (audio snippet, chords, or metadata) and outputs recommended guitar amp settings (amp model, gain, EQ, reverb, presence, effects). It’s designed to help guitarists quickly dial in tones that match the feel of a song without endless tweaking.

The system uses a FastAPI backend with audio analysis (via librosa) and optional ML models (PyTorch). A React + Tailwind frontend provides an upload form, visual knob controls, and preset management.

This project is structured for rapid prototyping — start with the rule-based MVP, then layer in machine learning models and cloud deployment.

Features

Input options:  provide song title/artist

Output: JSON with amp model + normalized knob values (gain, bass, mid, treble, presence, reverb)
 
 AI core: rule-based predictor (MVP) + hooks for PyTorch models

 Feedback loop: collect user ratings to refine future predictions

Deploy-ready: Dockerized backend, frontend deployable on Vercel/Netlify, backend on Render/Cloud Run

Extensible: support for exporting presets to popular amp sims (planned)

Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS

Backend: FastAPI (Python), librosa, optional PyTorch

Storage: S3 (or any object store), Postgres (Supabase recommended)

Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Vercel/Render/Cloud Run

Optional: Redis for job queueing, Hugging Face/Replicate for GPU inference

Setup insructions:
1. download repository
2. Go to backend of project (cd tone-ai-backend)
3. install requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Start Backend (uvicorn app:app --reload)
5. Go to frontend of project( cd front_end)
6. Install npm (npm install)

Contribution Summary: For the CS 2104 project, both carter and I worked on the same overarching process. To stay in the requirements for the project, we worked on different parts. The files for my project are in "front_end" and "tone-ai-backend" any other files are not part of my project.
